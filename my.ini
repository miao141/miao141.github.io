# Query cache is used to cache SELECT results andlater return them

# without actual executing the same query once again.Having the query

# cache enabled may result in significant speedimprovements, if your

# have a lot of identical queries and rarely changingtables. See the

# "Qcache_lowmem_prunes" status variable tocheck if the current value

# is high enough for your load.

# Note: In case your tables change very often or ifyour queries are

# textually different every time, the query cache mayresult in a

# slowdown instead of a performance improvement.

query_cache_size=0

 

# The number of open tables for all threads.Increasing this value

# increases the number of file descriptors that mysqldrequires.

# Therefore you have to make sure to set the amount ofopen files

# allowed to at least 4096 in the variable"open-files-limit" in

# section [mysqld_safe]

table_cache=256

 

# Maximum size for internal (in-memory) temporarytables. If a table

# grows larger than this value, it is automaticallyconverted to disk

# based table This limitation is for a single table.There can be many

# of them.

tmp_table_size=26M

 

 

# How many threads we should keep in a cache forreuse. When a client

# disconnects, the client's threads are put in thecache if there aren't

# more than thread_cache_size threads frombefore.  This greatly reduces

# the amount of thread creations needed if you have alot of new

# connections. (Normally this doesn't give a notableperformance

# improvement if you have a good threadimplementation.)

thread_cache_size=8

 

#*** MyISAM Specific options

 

# The maximum size of the temporary file MySQL isallowed to use while

# recreating the index (during REPAIR, ALTER TABLE orLOAD DATA INFILE.

# If the file-size would be bigger than this, theindex will be created

# through the key cache (which is slower).

myisam_max_sort_file_size=100G

 

# If the temporary file used for fast index creationwould be bigger

# than using the key cache by the amount specifiedhere, then prefer the

# key cache method. This is mainly used to force long character keys in

# large tables to use the slower key cache method tocreate the index.

myisam_sort_buffer_size=52M

 

# Size of the Key Buffer, used to cache index blocksfor MyISAM tables.

# Do not set it larger than 30% of your available memory,as some memory

# is also required by the OS to cache rows. Even ifyou're not using

# MyISAM tables, you should still set it to 8-64M asit will also be

# used for internal temporary disk tables.

key_buffer_size=40M

 

# Size of the buffer used for doing full table scansof MyISAM tables.

# Allocated per thread, if a full scan is needed.

read_buffer_size=64K

read_rnd_buffer_size=256K

 

# This buffer is allocated when MySQL needs to rebuildthe index in

# REPAIR, OPTIMZE, ALTER table statements as well asin LOAD DATA INFILE

# into an empty table. It is allocated per thread sobe careful with

# large settings.

sort_buffer_size=256K

 

 

#*** INNODB Specific options ***

#innodb_data_home_dir="C:\mysql\data\INNODB\"

 

# Use this option if you have a MySQL server withInnoDB support enabled

# but you do not plan to use it. This will save memoryand disk space

# and speed up some things.

#skip-innodb

 

# Additional memory pool that is used by InnoDB tostore metadata

# information. If InnoDB requires more memory for this purpose it will

# start to allocate it from the OS.  As this is fast enough on most

# recent operating systems, you normally do not needto change this

# value. SHOW INNODB STATUS will display the currentamount used.

innodb_additional_mem_pool_size=2M

 

# If set to 1, InnoDB will flush (fsync) thetransaction logs to the

# disk at each commit, which offers full ACIDbehavior. If you are

# willing to compromise this safety, and you arerunning small

# transactions, you may set this to 0 or 2 to reduce diskI/O to the

# logs. Value 0 means that the log is only written tothe log file and

# the log file flushed to disk approximately once persecond. Value 2

# means the log is written to the log file at eachcommit, but the log

# file is only flushed to disk approximately once persecond.

innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=1

 

# The size of the buffer InnoDB uses for buffering logdata. As soon as

# it is full, InnoDB will have to flush it to disk. Asit is flushed

# once per second anyway, it does not make sense tohave it very large

# (even with long transactions).

innodb_log_buffer_size=1M

 

# InnoDB, unlike MyISAM, uses a buffer pool to cacheboth indexes and

# row data. The bigger you set this the less disk I/Ois needed to

# access data in tables. On a dedicated databaseserver you may set this

# parameter up to 80% of the machine physical memorysize. Do not set it

# too large, though, because competition of thephysical memory may

# cause paging in the operating system.  Note that on 32bit systems you

# might be limited to 2-3.5G of user level memory perprocess, so do not

# set it too high.

innodb_buffer_pool_size=77M

 

# Size of each log file in a log group. You should setthe combined size

# of log files to about 25%-100% of your buffer poolsize to avoid

# unneeded buffer pool flush activity on log fileoverwrite. However,

# note that a larger logfile size will increase thetime needed for the

# recovery process.

innodb_log_file_size=39M

 

# Number of threads allowed inside the InnoDB kernel.The optimal value

# depends highly on the application, hardware as wellas the OS

# scheduler properties. A too high value may lead tothread thrashing.

innodb_thread_concurrency=8
